We’re concerned about the health of our loved ones, grateful for the medical heroes and essential workers in our communities, and trying our best to adapt to this new normal. We want to be optimistic, but the ongoing stress and uncertainty is affecting us all, and it’s hard not to worry about what the future holds.",

We invite you to share your thoughts with us — including your fears, frustrations, and hopes — as an audio or video recording by clicking the \"Share Your Thoughts\" link above.
